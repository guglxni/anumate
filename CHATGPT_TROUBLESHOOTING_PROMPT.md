# ChatGPT Troubleshooting Prompt for Portia SDK Integration Issue

## Problem Summary
I'm working on a Python FastAPI orchestrator service that needs to integrate with the Portia SDK (`portia-sdk-python` package). The service is designed to be SDK-only (no HTTP fallback) for a hackathon environment, but I'm having trouble with the correct module import path and configuration.

## Technical Context
- **Environment**: macOS with miniconda3 Python 3.12
- **Framework**: FastAPI with uvicorn
- **Package**: `portia-sdk-python` (installed via pip)
- **Project Structure**: Monorepo with services/orchestrator/ containing the FastAPI app

## Current Issue
1. **Package Installation**: `portia-sdk-python` is installed but I can't determine the correct module import name
2. **Import Error**: Getting import errors when trying to import Portia SDK components
3. **Module Discovery**: Need to find the actual Python module name that gets installed by `portia-sdk-python`

## What I've Tried
```bash
# Installed the package
pip install portia-sdk-python

# Tried various import patterns
import portia
import portia_sdk
import portia_sdk_python
from portia import Client
from portia_sdk import Client
```

## Code Context
Here's my current implementation that needs the correct import:

```python
# services/orchestrator/src/portia_client.py
try:
    from portia import Client as PortiaClient  # ??? What's the correct import?
    PORTIA_SDK_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError as e:
    PORTIA_SDK_AVAILABLE = False
    _import_error = str(e)

class PortiaClient:
    def __init__(self, api_key: str, base_url: str):
        if not PORTIA_SDK_AVAILABLE:
            raise ImportError(f"Portia SDK not available: {_import_error}")
        
        self.client = PortiaClient(api_key=api_key, base_url=base_url)
    
    async def execute_plan(self, plan_data: dict) -> dict:
        # Need to implement actual SDK calls
        pass
```

## Questions for ChatGPT
1. **What is the correct import statement for `portia-sdk-python`?**
   - What module name does this package actually install?
   - What are the main classes/functions I should import?

2. **How can I discover the correct module structure?**
   - Commands to inspect what `portia-sdk-python` actually installs
   - How to find the package's top-level module name

3. **Common import patterns for Portia SDK:**
   - Typical client initialization code
   - Authentication setup
   - Basic usage examples

4. **Package troubleshooting:**
   - How to verify the package is correctly installed
   - How to check if it's installed in the right Python environment
   - Common conda vs pip installation issues

## Expected SDK Usage Pattern
I need to implement these basic operations:
- Initialize a client with API key and base URL
- Execute/run plans (likely async operations)
- Handle errors and responses
- Perform readiness checks

## Environment Details
```bash
# Python environment
python --version  # Python 3.12.x
which python     # /Users/username/miniconda3/bin/python

# Package info
pip show portia-sdk-python
pip list | grep portia
```

## Request
Please provide:
1. The correct import statements for `portia-sdk-python`
2. Basic client initialization example
3. Commands to discover the package structure if my assumptions are wrong
4. Common troubleshooting steps for this specific package

If you're not familiar with `portia-sdk-python` specifically, please provide general guidance on how to:
- Discover the correct module name from a pip package
- Inspect installed package contents
- Debug Python import issues in conda environments
