# Non-Functional Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the enterprise-grade non-functional requirements for Anumate, covering security, privacy, observability, compliance, and operational excellence. These requirements ensure Anumate meets enterprise standards for multi-tenant SaaS deployment with robust security, privacy controls, and operational reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Tenancy and Data Isolation

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want complete tenant isolation using Row-Level Security (RLS), so that tenant data remains strictly segregated and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tenant user accesses data THEN the system SHALL enforce RLS policies to restrict access to only their tenant's data
2. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL automatically apply tenant context filters at the database level
3. WHEN a new tenant is onboarded THEN the system SHALL create isolated RLS policies for that tenant
4. IF a user attempts to access cross-tenant data THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt
5. WHEN tenant data is queried THEN the system SHALL ensure zero data leakage between tenants through database-level isolation

### Requirement 2: Identity and Access Management

**User Story:** As an enterprise customer, I want to integrate with my existing identity provider using OIDC/SAML SSO and manage users via SCIM, so that I can maintain centralized identity management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users authenticate THEN the system SHALL support OIDC and SAML 2.0 SSO protocols
2. WHEN SSO is configured THEN the system SHALL validate identity provider certificates and signatures
3. WHEN user provisioning occurs THEN the system SHALL support SCIM 2.0 for automated user lifecycle management
4. WHEN users are deprovisioned THEN the system SHALL immediately revoke access and clean up sessions
5. IF SSO authentication fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure and provide appropriate error messages
6. WHEN role mapping occurs THEN the system SHALL map identity provider groups to Anumate roles automatically

### Requirement 3: Secrets and Key Management

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want secrets managed through HashiCorp Vault and per-tenant KMS keys, so that sensitive data is properly encrypted and access-controlled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN secrets are stored THEN the system SHALL use HashiCorp Vault for centralized secret management
2. WHEN tenant data is encrypted THEN the system SHALL use per-tenant KMS keys for data encryption
3. WHEN secrets are accessed THEN the system SHALL authenticate with Vault using appropriate authentication methods
4. WHEN encryption keys are rotated THEN the system SHALL support seamless key rotation without service interruption

6. WHEN audit logs are generated THEN the system SHALL log all secret access and key usage events

### Requirement 4: Privacy and PII Protection

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want automatic PII detection and redaction capabilities, so that we maintain privacy compliance and data protection standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PII is detected in data THEN the system SHALL automatically redact or mask sensitive information

6. WHEN data retention policies apply THEN the system SHALL automatically purge PII according to configured schedules

### Requirement 5: Observability and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want comprehensive observability through OpenTelemetry tracing, metrics, and structured logging, so that I can monitor system health and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requests are processed THEN the system SHALL generate OpenTelemetry traces with proper span context

### Requirement 6: Audit and Compliance

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want comprehensive audit logging with WORM storage and configurable retention, so that we meet regulatory compliance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user actions occur THEN the system SHALL generate immutable audit logs
2. WHEN audit logs are stored THEN the system SHALL use WORM (Write Once, Read Many) storage
3. WHEN retention policies are configured THEN the system SHALL automatically manage log lifecycle
4. WHEN compliance reports are needed THEN the system SHALL provide audit trail export capabilities

6. WHEN regulatory requirements change THEN the system SHALL support configurable retention periods per tenant

### Requirement 7: High Availability and Scaling

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want the system to automatically scale and maintain high availability, so that users experience consistent performance regardless of load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN load increases THEN the system SHALL automatically scale horizontally based on defined metrics
2. WHEN component failures occur THEN the system SHALL maintain service availability through redundancy
3. WHEN scaling events happen THEN the system SHALL maintain session continuity and data consistency
4. WHEN maintenance is required THEN the system SHALL support zero-downtime deployments
5. IF cascading failures occur THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breakers and graceful degradation
6. WHEN geographic distribution is needed THEN the system SHALL support multi-region deployment

### Requirement 8: Disaster Recovery

**User Story:** As a business continuity manager, I want comprehensive disaster recovery capabilities, so that we can quickly restore service in case of major incidents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN disasters occur THEN the system SHALL support Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of 4 hours
2. WHEN data recovery is needed THEN the system SHALL support Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of 1 hour
3. WHEN failover is triggered THEN the system SHALL automatically redirect traffic to backup systems
4. WHEN backup restoration occurs THEN the system SHALL verify data integrity and consistency
5. IF primary systems fail THEN the system SHALL maintain critical functionality in disaster recovery mode
6. WHEN recovery is complete THEN the system SHALL support seamless failback to primary systems

### Requirement 9: Service Level Objectives

**User Story:** As a service owner, I want clearly defined and monitored SLOs, so that we maintain consistent service quality and user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN preflight operations execute THEN the system SHALL complete 95% of requests within 1.5 seconds
2. WHEN approval propagation occurs THEN the system SHALL complete propagation within 2 seconds
3. WHEN execute operations run THEN the system SHALL maintain 99% or higher success rate
4. WHEN webhooks are delivered THEN the system SHALL achieve 95th percentile latency under 5 seconds
5. IF SLO violations occur THEN the system SHALL trigger alerts and initiate remediation procedures
6. WHEN SLO reporting is needed THEN the system SHALL provide real-time and historical SLO metrics

### Requirement 10: Data Residency and Sovereignty

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want to control where tenant data is stored and processed, so that we meet data sovereignty and residency requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tenants are onboarded THEN the system SHALL allow specification of data residency requirements
2. WHEN data is stored THEN the system SHALL ensure data remains within specified geographic boundaries
3. WHEN data processing occurs THEN the system SHALL respect data sovereignty constraints
4. WHEN cross-border data transfer is required THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate safeguards
5. IF data residency violations are detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and prevent the violation
6. WHEN compliance audits occur THEN the system SHALL provide data location and movement reports

- Implement data classification and automatic routing
- Provide tenant-level data residency configuration
- Monitor and audit cross-border data movements
- Maintain compliance documentation per jurisdiction

### Cross-Border Data Transfer Safeguards
- Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for EU data transfers
- Adequacy decisions recognition and monitoring
- Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) with clear geographic constraints
- Regular assessment of international data transfer regulations
