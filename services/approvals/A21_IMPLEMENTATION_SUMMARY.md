### 🔄 Workflow Execution Flow

#### **1. Workflow Creation**
```
Developer → POST /v1/workflows/approvals → Workflow Engine
  ↓
Workflow created with multiple approval steps
  ↓
Notifications sent to first approver group
  ↓
CloudEvent: "workflow.created" published
```

#### **2. Step-by-Step Approval**
```
Approver → POST /v1/workflows/{id}/approve-step → Workflow Engine
  ↓
Current step marked as approved
  ↓
Workflow advanced to next step
  ↓
Notifications sent to next approver group
  ↓
