# Policy Enforcement Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of task A.8 "Implement Policy enforcement mechanisms" from the Anumate Platform MVP specification. The implementation provides comprehensive policy enforcement capabilities including middleware, data redaction, drift detection, and violation reporting.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Policy Middleware (`middleware.py`)

**Purpose**: FastAPI middleware for enforcing policies across API endpoints

**Key Features**:
- Pre-request policy evaluation with allow/deny decisions
- Post-request response filtering and redaction
- Request context extraction (user, tenant, headers, etc.)
- Policy violation creation and handling
- Configurable enforcement settings (fail-open/fail-closed)
- Policy caching with TTL for performance

**Usage**:
```python
from middleware import PolicyEnforcementMiddleware, PolicyEnforcementConfig

config = PolicyEnforcementConfig(
    enabled=True,
    redaction_enabled=True,
    fail_open=False
)

middleware = PolicyEnforcementMiddleware(
    app=app,
    config=config,
    policy_loader=lambda: {"policy_name": "policy_source"}
)
```

### 2. Data Redaction Filter (`middleware.py`)

**Purpose**: Apply policy-based data redaction to sensitive information

**Key Features**:
- Pattern-based redaction using regex
- Field-specific redaction for structured data
- Nested data structure support (dicts, lists)
- Policy-driven redaction rules
- Configurable replacement patterns

**Usage**:
```python
from middleware import PolicyRedactionFilter

filter = PolicyRedactionFilter(engine)
redacted_data = filter.redact_data(
    data=sensitive_data,
    policies=["pii_protection"],
    context={"user": {"role": "user"}}
)
```

### 3. Drift Detection (`drift_detector.py`)

**Purpose**: Monitor policy compliance and detect behavioral drift

**Key Features**:
- Baseline establishment from historical data
- Compliance drift detection (success rate changes)
- Performance drift detection (evaluation time changes)
- Rule coverage drift (rules stopping/changing frequency)
- Violation pattern analysis (suspicious user behavior)
- Configurable drift thresholds and time windows
- Automated remediation suggestions

**Drift Types Detected**:
- `COMPLIANCE_DEGRADATION`: Policy success rate declining
- `POLICY_BYPASS`: Multiple violations from same user
- `UNEXPECTED_BEHAVIOR`: Rule firing frequency changes
- `PERFORMANCE_DRIFT`: Evaluation time increases
- `COVERAGE_GAP`: Rules stop firing entirely

**Usage**:
```python
from drift_detector import PolicyDriftDetector

detector = PolicyDriftDetector(
    engine=policy_engine,
    baseline_window=3600,  # 1 hour baseline
    detection_window=300,  # 5 minute detection
    drift_threshold=0.15   # 15% drift threshold
)

# Record evaluations for analysis
detector.record_evaluation(policy_name, evaluation_result, eval_time, context)

# Get active alerts
alerts = detector.get_active_alerts()
```

### 4. Violation Reporting (`violation_reporter.py`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive violation reporting and alerting system

**Key Features**:
- Real-time violation recording and processing
- Configurable alert rules with pattern matching
- Multiple notification channels (log, webhook, email, etc.)
- Rate limiting and escalation thresholds
- Comprehensive violation reports with trends and analytics
- Export capabilities (JSON, CSV, PDF, HTML)
- Quiet hours and geographic restrictions

**Alert Rule Configuration**:
```python
from violation_reporter import AlertRule, AlertChannel

rule = AlertRule(
    rule_id="critical_violations",
    name="Critical Policy Violations",
    policy_patterns=["*security*"],
    severity_levels=["CRITICAL"],
    channels=[AlertChannel.LOG, AlertChannel.WEBHOOK],
    rate_limit=5,
    escalation_threshold=3
)
```

**Report Generation**:
```python
report = reporter.generate_violation_report(
    start_time=start_time,
    end_time=end_time,
    title="Security Violation Report",
    include_raw_data=False
)
```

### 5. Integrated Enforcement System (`enforcement.py`)

**Purpose**: Unified interface combining all enforcement components

**Key Features**:
- Single configuration point for all enforcement features
- Component integration and orchestration
- Health monitoring and statistics
- Policy management (add/remove/update)
- FastAPI integration helpers
- Cleanup and maintenance utilities

**Usage**:
```python
from enforcement import create_enforcement_system, setup_fastapi_enforcement

# Create integrated system
system = create_enforcement_system(
    policies=policy_dict,
    enable_drift_detection=True,
    enable_violation_reporting=True
)

# Or integrate with FastAPI
system = setup_fastapi_enforcement(
    app=fastapi_app,
    policies=policy_dict
)
```

## Policy DSL Integration

The enforcement system integrates seamlessly with the existing Policy DSL engine:

### Supported Policy Actions

- `allow()` / `deny()`: Access control decisions
- `log(level, message)`: Audit logging
- `alert(severity, message)`: Real-time alerting
- `redact(pattern, replacement)`: Data redaction
- `require_approval(approvers)`: Approval workflows

### Example Policy for Enforcement

```policy
policy "API Security Policy" {
    rule "Admin Access" {
        when user.role == "admin" and user.active == true
        then {
            allow()
            log(level="info", message="Admin access granted")
        }
        priority: 100
    }
    
    rule "PII Protection" {
        when contains_pii(data.content)
        then {
            alert(severity="medium", message="PII detected")
            redact(pattern="[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}", 
                   replacement="[EMAIL_REDACTED]")
        }
        priority: 90
    }
    
    rule "Rate Limiting" {
        when context.request_count > 100
        then {
            deny()
            alert(severity="high", message="Rate limit exceeded")
        }
        priority: 95
    }
}
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Policy Evaluation
- **Compilation**: Policies compiled once and cached
- **Evaluation**: Optimized with short-circuit logic
- **Caching**: TTL-based policy cache (default 5 minutes)
- **Timeout**: Configurable evaluation timeout (default 5 seconds)

### Memory Management
- **Bounded Collections**: All metrics use bounded deques
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Configurable data retention (default 24 hours)
- **Cache Limits**: Policy cache size limits to prevent memory leaks

### Scalability
- **Thread Safety**: All components are thread-safe
- **Async Support**: Full async/await support for FastAPI
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting for alerts and processing
- **Circuit Breakers**: Graceful degradation on component failures

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- All policy inputs validated and sanitized
- Regex patterns validated before compilation
- Context data type checking and bounds validation

### Resource Protection
- Evaluation timeouts prevent DoS attacks
- Rate limiting prevents alert spam
- Memory bounds prevent resource exhaustion
- Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures

### Audit Trail
- All policy evaluations logged with correlation IDs
- Violation records are immutable once created
- Comprehensive audit trail for compliance
- Secure storage of sensitive policy decisions

## Configuration Options

### PolicyEnforcementConfig

```python
@dataclass
class PolicyEnforcementConfig:
    enabled: bool = True
    policy_cache_ttl: int = 300  # 5 minutes
    evaluation_timeout: float = 5.0  # 5 seconds
    log_all_evaluations: bool = True
    fail_open: bool = False  # Fail secure by default
    redaction_enabled: bool = True
    drift_detection_enabled: bool = True
```

### Alert Rule Configuration

```python
@dataclass
class AlertRule:
    rule_id: str
    name: str
    enabled: bool = True
    policy_patterns: List[str] = []
    violation_types: List[str] = []
    severity_levels: List[str] = []
    min_severity: str = "LOW"
    rate_limit: Optional[int] = None
    escalation_threshold: int = 5
    channels: List[AlertChannel] = []
    recipients: List[str] = []
    quiet_hours: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
```

## Integration Points

### FastAPI Integration
